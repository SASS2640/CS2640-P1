# CS2640-P1

#task 1: user input and output
#get 2 ints from the user (prompt 1 and prompt 2) 
#two user values should be held in register s$s0 and $s1
#output user inputs in the Run "I/O" section in Mars environmetn back to user 

#task 2: arithmetic operation practice
#add two values (use instruction "add")
#subtract two values (use instruction "sub")
#multiply two values (use instruction "mul")
#divide two values (use instruction "div")
#Output the arithmetic results in the "Run I/O" section in MARS environment back to the user

#task 3: conditions
#If the two user inputs from Task 1 are equal to each other, output "User inputs are the same"
#If the two user inputs from Task 1 are not equal to each other, output "User inputs are different"
